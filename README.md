## HFAP 

**HFAP** stands for Help the Flood Affected People. Every year numerous number of people are affected by floods from rivers and sea. A research has shown that around 147 million people will be affected by flood by the end of the decade. 

Our goal is to help the affected people to the service from doctor and get required information from doctor in the critical time. For that purpose, we created an environment where affected people can get service from doctor by GSM or any android and pc.
